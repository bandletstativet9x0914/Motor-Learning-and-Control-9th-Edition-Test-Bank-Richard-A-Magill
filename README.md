### Product Details:


* ISBN-10 ‏ : ‎ 0073523801
* * ISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-0073523804
  * * Author: Richard A. Magill
   
  * The text provides an introductory study of motor learning and control for students who aspire to become practitioners in exercise science, physical education, and other movement-oriented professions. Magill opens with an introduction to motor skills and control, continues through attention, memory, and learning, and ends with a discussion of instruction, feedback, and practice methods. The text's strong research base, clear presentation and practical applications will help students build a solid foundation in motor skills and prepare them for further exploration on their own.
